        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; add 1/2 of the ground beef with a big pinch of salt and pepper and cook until the beef is seared and crumbly, about 5 minutes. 
                Remove beef from the pan and cook the remainder. Set all meat aside
            </li>

            <li>Lower the heat to medium-low and add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the onion. 
                Saute until aromatic, about 2 minutes. Add tomato paste and oregano, followed by the ground beef and one jar of sauce. 
                Stir to combine and reduce to a simmer. Add salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>

            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add shells and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. 
                Strain; feel free to reserve some pasta water to add to the sauce if you like.
            </li>

            <li>Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in another pan over medium heat and add the garlic. 
                Saute until lightly golden. Transfer garlic to a mixing bowl with ricotta, mozzarella, spinach, basil, and lemon zest and juice. 
                Add salt to taste.
            </li>

            <li>Pour remaining tomato sauce into a 9x13-inch baking dish. 
                Spoon the cheese mixture into the shells followed by the meat mixture. 
                As you finish stuffing each shell, place it in the sauce. Top with Parmesan cheese.
            </li>
            
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the shells are hot in the center and the mozzarella cheese is melted and bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
